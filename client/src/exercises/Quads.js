    + 'Squats are highly effective for building lower body strength, improving overall athleticism, and enhancing functional movement '

    description: 'Leg extensions are an isolation exercise that primarily targets the quadriceps muscles of the thighs. '
    + 'To perform leg extensions, sit on a leg extension machine with your knees bent and feet hooked under the padded lever. '
    + 'Extend your legs upward against the resistance of the machine until your legs are straight, then lower them back down under '
    + 'control to complete one repetition. Leg extensions are effective for strengthening the quadriceps and are often included in '
    + 'lower body workout routines to complement compound exercises like squats and lunges.',

    name: 'Split Squats',
    description: 'Split squats, also known as stationary lunges, are a unilateral lower body exercise that targets the quadriceps, '
    + 'hamstrings, glutes, and calves. To perform split squats, stand in a split stance with one foot forward and the other foot '
    + 'extended behind you on a bench or elevated surface. Lower your body by bending both knees until the back knee nearly touches '
    + 'the ground, then push through the front heel to return to the starting position. Split squats help improve balance, coordination, '
    + 'and lower body strength while also addressing muscular imbalances between the legs.',
